# Mini-Turtle-Language
Implement a mini turtle language for a turtle program that is part of [Turtle Graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics)
The focus of this project is on implementing different OOP design patterns as part of a solution for language interpretation.  OOP deign patterns include: Memento, Visitor, and Interpretor.  Note: the focus of this project is not the actual graphics and thus has been left out.  Junit tests were created to appropriatly test the turtle program.
